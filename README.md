# BrowserStack Cypress CLI
You can now run your Cypress tests in BrowserStack using our `browserstack-cypress-cli`. BrowserStack currently supports Cypress 4 and you can start testing on the following browser combinations:


|       Windows 10    |      OS X Mojave      |    OS X Catalina    |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Chrome 66.0 to 79.0 |   Chrome 66.0 to 79.0 | Chrome 66.0 to 79.0 |
|     Edge 80.0       |       Edge 80.0       |      Edge 80.0      |
| Firefox 60.0 to 72.0|  Firefox 60.0 to 72.0 | Firefox 60.0 to 72.0|


We are actively working on supporting other browsers and will start adding other browsers to this list.

## Using BrowserStack-Cypress CLI:


### Installing browserstack-cypress
```bash
# Install cypress (ignore if already done)
$ npm install -g cypress@4.0.2

# Install the BrowserStack Cypress CLI
$ npm install -g browserstack-cypress-cli
```

### Configuring your tests
```bash
# create a sample configuration file for configurations and capabilities
$ browserstack-cypress init
```

This will create a sample `browserstack.json` file. This file can be used to configure your test runs on BrowserStack. Below is the sample file that is generated for your reference.

```json
{
    "auth": {
      "username": "<your-browserstack-username>",
      "access_key": "<your-browserstack-access-key>"
    },
    "browsers": [
      {
        "browser": "chrome",
        "os": "OS X Catalina",
        "versions": ["69","66"]
      }
    ],
    "run_settings": {
      "cypress_proj_dir": "/path/to/directory-that-contains-<cypress.json>-file",
      "project": "my first project",
      "customBuildName": "build 1"
    },
    "connection_settings": {
      "local": false
    }
}
```

The following table provides a reference for all the options that can be provided in `browserstack.json` shown above.


| Option          | Description                                                                                                                                 | Possible values                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `username`        | This is your BrowserStack username. You can find this in your [Automate dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) | -                                                                                                                             |
| `access_key`      | This is your BrowserStack access key. You can find this in your [Automate dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) | -                                                                                                                             |
| `os` <br/> (_case-sensitive_)              | The operating system on which you want to run your test.                                                                                    | `OS X Mojave`, <br/> `OS X Catalina`, and <br/> `Windows 10`                                       |
| `browser` <br/> (case-sensitive)         | The browser on which you want to run your tests.                                                                                         | `chrome`, <br/> `firefox`, and <br/> `edge`                                   |

| `specs` <br/> (_deprecated_)           | This param is deprecated in favour of a more complete `cypress_proj_dir` param. The path to the spec files that need to be run on BrowserStack                                                                              | Takes a list of strings that point to location of the spec files                                                              |

| `local`           | Helps in testing websites that cannot be accessed in public network. If you set this to `true`, please download the Local binary and establish a local connection first (you can learn how to do so [here](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/automate#command-line))                                                                       | Boolean: `true` / `false`. Set this to `true` if you need to test a local website. Set this to `false` if the website is accessible publicly.              |

**Note:** Each browser version represents a session. It is advised to validate your account's parallel limit before running multiple versions.

### Stopping a running build
In case you want to stop a running build, you can use the following command

```bash
browserstack-cypress build-stop <buildId>
```

Example

```bash
browserstack-cypress build-stop 06f28ce423d10314b32e98bb6f68e10b0d02a49a
```

Output:

```bash
[3/24/2020, 2:31:11 PM]  Stopping build with given buildId 06f28ce423d10314b32e98bb6f68e10b0d02a49a

[3/24/2020, 2:31:14 PM]  {
  "message": "stopped 1 sessions",
  "stopped_session_count": 1
}
```

### Limitations

- `exec` and `task` are not allowed.
- While using local, please make sure to create `/etc/hosts` entry pointing to some URL, and use that URL in the tests. The `localhost` URI doesn't work at the moment.
- Installing custom npm packages are not supported at this moment.
